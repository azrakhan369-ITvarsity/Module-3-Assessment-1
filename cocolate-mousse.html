            <h2>Method</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat half of the cream (250mls) in a small saucepan over medium-high heat until bubbles begin to form around the edges.</li>
                <li>Place the chopped chocolate into a heatproof bowl. When the cream is heated, pour it over the chocolate and add the vanilla. Leave to melt for a minute, then stir with a whisk until all of the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth and well combined.</li>
                <li>Whisk in the remaining 250ml of cream. Adding this cold cream helps to cool the mixture down faster.</li>
                <li>Taste the mixture, and if the chocolate is a little too bitter you can add some caster or icing (confectioner’s) sugar until it’s as sweet as you want it.</li>
                <li>Cover and chill the mousse mixture until it is very cold. This can either be done in the fridge or freezer.
                    Fridge – refrigerate for several hours or overnight.
                    Freezer – place in the freezer for 1 hour, stirring every 10-15 minutes to make sure it doesn't freeze around the edges.
                    Chilling overnight in the fridge is the best option and gives the best results, but sometimes we just want mousse in a hurry, so the freezer option is there if you need it.</li>
                <li>Whip the chocolate cream with an electric hand mixer just until stiff peaks form. It won’t take very long, be careful not to overwhip it.</li>
                <li>Pipe or spoon the mousse into glasses or small bowls. You can serve it immediately for a softer, smoother mousse, or chill for an hour or two for a fluffier mousse.</li>
                <li>Store, covered, in the fridge for several days</li>
            </ol>
